844 Project Data Processing: codes general processing and exploratory data analysis; Codes for producing final dataset are included in each of the following model codes.

844 Project MARS, RF, svm, glmnet, gbm training and tuning codes: each for training the specified model; All lines for generating csv files as final predictions are commented out. RF and gbm models may take longer time to run and since the dataset is relatively large, restarting R session for re-initiation of h2o environment may be needed. 

844 Project ensemble: after producing final predictions from all above models, this code implement ensemble methods for final prediction. More details found in report.
